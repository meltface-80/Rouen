   * TWO ZOOM HACKS USED TO LIVE HERE. Both are gone (v1.8.42), with the
   * viewport meta's `maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no`, and the reasons are
   * worth keeping because each of them made a real bug.
   *
   * 1. `gesturestart/gesturechange/gestureend` were preventDefault()ed to
   *    re-impose the pinch-zoom block that iOS Safari refuses to honour from
   *    the viewport meta. IT WORKED, AND THAT WAS THE PROBLEM: pinching is the
   *    only way a person can get a mis-scaled page back, so with this in place
   *    a page that came back from a rotation at the wrong scale could not be
   *    recovered at all. That is exactly the reported symptom — "force closing
   *    is the only way to restore function". The app took away the escape.
   *
   * 2. A `touchend` that preventDefault()ed any tap within 320ms of the last
   *    one, to suppress double-tap zoom. preventDefault on touchend CANCELS
   *    THE CLICK, so this also turned "that tap did nothing" into "nothing
   *    works": somebody whose first tap misses taps again straight away, and
   *    every impatient repeat was cancelled by this. It could only ever make a
   *    dead-feeling screen deader.
   *
   * Neither was buying anything. Double-tap-to-zoom is already off the correct
   * way — `touch-action: manipulation` on html/body in style.css — which
   * suppresses the double-tap gesture WITHOUT disabling pinch. The two hacks
   * were belt-and-braces over a rule that was already doing the job properly,
   * and between them they cost the user every way out of a bad frame.
   *
   * test/static/viewport-scale.test.js keeps them from coming back.

   * THE WINDOW MUST NEVER BE SCROLLED. Keep it pinned.
   *
   * This is the iOS home-screen-app freeze, found with the instrument rather
   * than guessed at — v1.8.40 and v1.8.42 each shipped a theory and each was
   * wrong. What the readout actually said, from a phone with dead buttons:
   *
   *     win 440x894   doc 440x894          the layout viewport is NOT stale
   *     vv  440x894 scale=1                the page is NOT scaled
   *     vv off=0,62   page=0,62
   *     scrollXY 0,62                <---- THE WINDOW IS SCROLLED 62px
   *     every tap: top=img#modal-img
   *
   * The buttons were never dead. The window had scrolled down 62 pixels, so
   * hit-testing ran 62px below the paint: a press on the Back button at
   * (35, 31) was tested at (35, 93) and landed on the album artwork, which
   * does nothing. Every control on every screen behaves that way at once,
   * which is why it reads as "nothing works" rather than as a misplaced tap.
   * 62px is this device's top safe-area inset, and the app is only standalone
   * — `viewport-fit=cover` with live insets — in a home-screen app, which is
   * why Safari and Chrome on the same phone were fine.
   *
   * SO THIS IS NOT A WORKAROUND FOR A SCROLL: it enforces an invariant the app
   * already declares. `html, body { overflow: hidden }` and the shell is
   * `position: fixed`; only <main> scrolls, and it scrolls itself. A non-zero
   * window scroll is therefore not a state this app has, at any size, on any
   * screen — so snapping it back cannot discard a position anybody wanted.
   *
   * THE ONE EXCEPTION IS A FOCUSED TEXT FIELD. iOS scrolls the window to lift
   * an input clear of the keyboard, and fighting that would park the field
   * under the keys — trading a bug nobody can see for one everybody can.

  // nothing), watches playback, rolls a change back if it stops or cannot
  // keep up, and works out the warning each picker shows beside each choice.

  //
  // Asked for on the Roon forum by someone running both pages on one iPad in a
  // kiosk browser: a way to flip between the remote and the wall display, and a
  // timer that goes back to the display once the remote has been left alone —
  // the display as the remote's screensaver.
  //
  // Both ways are an ordinary navigation in the same tab: "Wall display" in the
  // side menu here, "Remote" on the display (shown when it is tapped). Going TO
  // the display pushes a history entry and marks the tab (sessionStorage), and
  // the display's way back is then history.back(): the remote comes back as it
  // was left when the browser has kept the page, the browser's own Back agrees
  // with the button, and flipping a hundred times leaves two entries rather
  // than two hundred. A display opened any other way (a kiosk's start page, a
  // bookmark) has no remote behind it, so it loads one.
  //
  // The display is sent THIS remote's zone: it is this remote's screen, and a
  // display left to find "the first zone playing" can show a room the remote
  // is not controlling.
  //
  // The timer is PER DEVICE and off unless chosen — the wall iPad wants it, the
  // phone in a pocket does not. It never throws work away: it waits while
  // Settings, a sheet, the label tools or a selection is open. And it does
  // nothing while the wall display is switched off, because the page it would
  // open says only that.
