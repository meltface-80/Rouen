 *
 *  THE DESCRIPTION SITS BELOW THE ART, NOT BESIDE IT. In the column beside a
 *  424px cover it had ~600px to wrap in and whatever vertical room the title
 *  and artist had not taken, which on a four-line title was none — so the text
 *  the server had gone and fetched was routinely dropped. Underneath it has the
 *  full pane width, and the CARD GROWS to hold it, so the constraint is the
 *  prose rather than the frame.
 *
 *  The height is therefore computed, not fixed: everything is measured first,
 *  then the canvas is sized, then it is drawn. A card with no description comes
 *  out at the 600px it always was.
 *
 *  The card used to be a hard vertical split: art on the left half, a flat
 *  #0e1012 slab on the right. It now reads the way the app does — the artwork
 *  IS the background, and a translucent pane sits on it holding the sharp
 *  cover and the text.
 *
 *  THE SOFTENING IS A DOWNSCALE, NOT A BLUR. `ctx.filter = 'blur()'` is not
 *  dependable across the browsers this runs in, so the ground is the cover
 *  drawn into a 24px offscreen canvas and scaled back up — bilinear
 *  interpolation does the work. That is the same trick the app's own ambient
 *  layer uses (see #modal-ambient in style.css), and it costs one tiny draw.
 *
 *  The card stays dark in every theme. It is a standalone image that will be
 *  seen outside the app, on backgrounds nobody here controls, and the wordmark
 *  and the text colours are built for a dark ground.
