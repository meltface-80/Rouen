// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One HQPlayer: what it can do right now, the change engine, undo, and a
// shared status poller. Ported from hqpweb (apps/server/src/instance.ts and
// the change parser in app.ts), MIT, (c) 2026 statelycurmudgeon — see
// ./LICENSE. hqpweb's own HQPlayer-library browsing and its transport are not
// ported: MusicD Remote plays through Roon, which already has both.
//
// THE CHANGE ENGINE: resolve names to indices → apply in a fixed order → read
// State back → if the change could disturb playback and something was
// playing, watch it → if playback stopped or cannot keep up, record the
// combination as failed and roll back to what was there before.
//
// Brought up to hqpweb 0.1.0-beta.2 (+ 65b3888) in v1.8.78: a rollback never
// raises the volume (volume.js), a rollback that fails part-way still reports
// rather than throwing, HQPlayer's own processing speed and its apodization
// and clip counters reach the screen, a volume that jumps without this app is
// flagged, and the track HQPlayer's own playlist would play next is read while
// it is stopped, because a track that cannot start leaves Status blank.
//
// Three rules from hqpweb's measured fact base run through all of it:
//   * An OK reply proves nothing. HQPlayer answers OK to settings it then
//     ignores, so State, read back afterwards, is the verdict.
//   * Setters take LIST INDICES, and the lists change with the mode and the
//     engine version, so names are resolved at the moment of use, every time.
//   * Volume is a float in dB, it is clamped to what HQPlayer reports, it is
//     never raised by more than 6 dB in one step, and a rollback never raises it.
