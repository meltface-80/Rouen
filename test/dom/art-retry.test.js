// v1.7.89: album covers that lose one race must not stay lost.
//
// `/api/image` answers 503 whenever the extension is still connecting to the
// Roon Core and the art is not already in the on-disk store:
//
//     if (!core) return res.status(503).end();
//
// A cold app open lands squarely in that window. Home deliberately repaints
// from its saved copy the instant the page loads — that is the whole point of
// the localStorage cache — while pairing takes a second or two. Every <img>
// that lost the race fired onerror, and onerror did this:
//
//     img.onerror = () => { wrap.classList.add("no-image"); img.remove(); };
//
// One failure, a music note for the life of the page, even though the art
// became available moments later and nothing ever asked again. Which rows were
// affected came down to which requests happened to be in flight, which is why
// the same screen showed covers on some carousels and notes on others.
//
// Reproduced here by failing the first N image requests and then serving them,
// which is what a Core connecting mid-load looks like from the browser.
