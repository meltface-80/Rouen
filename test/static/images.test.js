// Nothing in this suite can run GitHub Actions, so the workflows are pinned as
// text: the parts that would quietly break the promise if they drifted.
//
//   * `latest` moves ONLY in latest.yml, and only for the release marked
//     Latest. A merge — still a pre-release — must never reach anyone pulling
//     latest, and nobody would notice until an untested build did.
//   * Every image is built for both x86 and 64-bit ARM, and carries
//     MUSICD_IMAGE, which is how the app knows to offer pulling the image
//     beside its one-tap update (v1.8.71).
//   * The image keeps the paths, port and user of the containers people already
//     run, so an existing data volume works when they switch.
