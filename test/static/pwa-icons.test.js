// v1.7.66: pinning the iOS full-screen contract.
//
// This cost six versions (v1.7.60 → v1.7.65) and five wrong diagnoses. The
// mechanism, finally: `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style: black-translucent`
// shifts the document UP under the status bar without growing the layout
// viewport, so the gap it leaves at the BOTTOM equals the TOP inset — 44-62px,
// not the 34px of a home indicator. That is why the band looked too tall and
// appeared on every screen.
//
// The reason it took so long is worth writing down, because no assertion can
// fix it: `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` and `-status-bar-style` are read by
// iOS at ADD-TO-HOME-SCREEN time, NOT on each launch, while viewport-fit=cover
// IS re-read every launch. So a shortcut created against a bad build keeps the
// bad window configuration forever, and no server-side change can be observed
// through it. Every "not fixed" report was true AND every fix may have been
// live — the two are not contradictory, and that is the trap.
//
// What CAN be pinned is the known-good state, which is what these do. v1.6.50
// is the reference: installed, confirmed filling an iPhone screen, and its
// shell is byte-identical to today's.
