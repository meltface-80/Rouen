// Focus facets — v1.7.35.

// The Focus sheet went from three categories to ten, and the two ways it can
// go wrong are both silent:
//
//   1. COUNTING AND FILTERING DISAGREEING. The sheet says "Jazz (212)" and the
//      wall then shows 190 albums. Neither number looks broken on its own, and
//      the user has no way to tell which one lied. That is why both sides read
//      libFacetDefs() — and why the tests below drive the shipping table rather
//      than a copy declared beside them. A duplicated vocabulary is how a facet
//      whose predicate changed would sail past a green suite.
//
//   2. EXCLUSION READING AS INCLUSION. Roon's tap-again-to-invert is encoded in
//      the value ("!Pop"), so a single missing "!" turns "everything except
//      Pop" into "only Pop" — a filter that still returns albums, just the
//      complement of the ones asked for.
