//
//   1. Unknown release years. v1.6.57 reversed the WHOLE list for descending,
//      which floated every undated album to the top of "newest first". They are
//      unknown, not year zero, and must sit at the end in BOTH directions.
//   2. What `dir` means. Before v1.6.58 the server inverted plays/lastplayed,
//      so "asc" produced most-played-first while "asc" everywhere else produced
//      least-first. One arrow control cannot point two ways, so the inversion
//      was removed and the client now picks each sort's default direction. If
//      it ever comes back, the arrow silently lies.
