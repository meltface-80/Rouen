// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// v1.7.38: the genre harvest skips genres that haven't changed.
//
// The harvest costs ~6 Roon calls per genre — about 180 per sync — and it ran
// in full every time the library changed at all, even if the change had nothing
// to do with genres. Roon states each genre's album count in the subtitle of
// the root listing we ALREADY fetch, so the fingerprint that decides whether a
// genre needs walking is free; it was simply being discarded one line later.
//
// Two things here are dangerous in opposite directions:
//
//   1. SKIPPING TOO EAGERLY. A fingerprint that can't tell two states apart
//      suppresses the only thing that would fix it. `parseAlbumCount` returns
//      null for an unparseable subtitle, and `null === null` would skip every
//      genre forever with no data at all — a silent, permanent empty facet.
//   2. THE MAPPING THAT COULD ONLY GROW. Before this version the harvest did
//      `(prev || []).concat(name)`, making album→genres a monotonic union: an
//      album could gain a genre but never lose one, and NO full walk could
//      correct it. A skip on top of that would have been building on sand, so
//      the union is replaced here too — a walked genre's membership is rebuilt
//      from scratch, which is what finally makes removal expressible.
