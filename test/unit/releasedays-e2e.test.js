// v1.8.61, end to end: the library from the report, through the real pipeline.
//
// Two screenshots, the same library sorted newest-first: Roon's top was
// ACTORS, Clinic, Emile Parisien, Europe; this extension's was Beck, Rhiannon
// Giddens, The Proclaimers — every one of them wearing the Q badge.
//
// Everything below is the shipping code, extracted: the favourites harvest,
// the /music walk's harvest (tags read through fileTagDate, as the walk reads
// them), setAlbumYear's rules, the MusicBrainz day lookups (MusicBrainz itself
// stubbed to the true dates), and the Library's own sort. The true dates are
// the order Roon shows.
//
// The TAGS are the fixture's one assumption, and the one thing this test
// cannot check against the real library: the local albums' tags state only
// the year, as many taggers write them. Under it, stage 1 — every source this
// extension read before v1.8.61, at any time after a start — IS the reported
// order: the favourites are the only albums with a day, so they lead, and the
// sort orders by which source knew the day. `GET /api/debug/dates` shows,
// album by album, what the real library holds.
